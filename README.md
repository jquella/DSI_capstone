# Best of the Best: 
## Predicting and Analyzing the All-NBA Team Awards


_Jamie Quella - 7/17/18_

**Goal:** The primary goal of this project was to predict a year’s All-NBA team from that season’s player stats and team information. The secondary goal was to use the predictive model as a starting point for further player analysis, for example, in examining where the model and reality differed.


**Process:** 
1. [Define Question.](#define_question)
2. [Gather Data.](#gather_data)
3. [Explore Data.](#explore_data)
4. [Model Data.](#model_data)
5. [Evaluate Model.](#evaluate_model)
6. [Answer Question.](#answer_question)

## Define the Question.
**Can we predict who gets on the three All-NBA teams based on their season stats, and information about their team?**

*Additional background and motivation*
------
**What is the All-NBA Award / what are we predicting?**
Three teams - 1st, 2nd, 3rd - of five players are voted on by the sports media from these positions types:

These players are honored as the best at their respective positions.

**So why should we care?**
1. *It can affect NBA contracts:* Award winners can command a higher salary.
2. *It can help a player's chance at getting into the Hall of Fame*: These accolades are often brought up when reviewing a player's HOF resume.
3. *You could bet on it in Vegas if you believe in your model:* You'd need to find good odds, too.
4. *I love NBA basketball and though it would be a neat project*

## Gather Data.
NBA player data from 1989-2017 was collected from a subset of the data found [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats/data).
